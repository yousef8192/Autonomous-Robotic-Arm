## Introduction

This Project is enthusiastically implemented by a group of Engineering students at Faculty of Engineering Ain Shams University.
<br/>
<br/>
Much research & planning was done before the project. Many Plans & ideas were considered. In addition to that, lots of potential problems were discussed.
<br/>
<br/>
Many problems where faced during the process of the design and implementation of the project. These problems were carefully tackled via innovative Engineering approaches.
<br/>
<br/>
This Project involves a lot of aspects. It mainly consists of two major sectors :<br/>
* Electrical Design Sector<br/>
    - Transducer/Circuit/PCB<br/>
    - Programming/Automation<br/>
<br/>
* Mechanical Design Sector<br/>
    - Statics (Supports/Weights)<br/>
    - Dynamics (Motors/Degree of Freedom)<br/>
